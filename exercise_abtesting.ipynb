    "# A/B Testing the Udacity Website\n",
    "\n",
    "In these exercises, we'll be analyzing data on user behavior from an experiment run by Udacity, the online education company. More specifically, we'll be looking at a test Udacity ran to improve the onboarding process on their site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Udacity's test is an example of an \"A/B\" test, in which some portion of users visiting a website (or using an app) are randomly selected to see a new version of the site. An analyst can then compare the behavior of users who see a new website design to users seeing their normal website to estimate the effect of rolling out the proposed changes to all users. While this kind of experiment has it's own name in industry (A/B testing), to be clear it's just a randomized experiment, and so everything we've learned about potential outcomes and randomized experiments apply here. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Udacity has generously provides the data from this test under an Apache open-source license, and you can find their [original writeup here](https://www.kaggle.com/tammyrotem/ab-tests-with-python/notebook). If you're interested in learning more on A/B testing in particular, it seems only fair while we use their data to flag they have a full course on the subject [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257).)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Udacity's Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The test [is described by Udacity as follows](https://www.kaggle.com/tammyrotem/ab-tests-with-python/notebook): \n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Conditions Before Change**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the student clicks \"start free trial\", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first.\n",
    "- If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of Experimented Change**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course.\n",
    "- If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free.\n",
    "- At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. This [screenshot](images/udacity_checkyoureready.png) shows what the experiment looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Udacity's Hope is that...**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough time -- without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.\n"

The good news is, there were no significant negative impacts on user engagement (guardrail metrics), suggesting that the changes didn't harm user experience. Despite the promising increase in payment rate, the lack of a significant improvement in the OEC suggests caution before a full rollout. The experiment's outcomes reveal mixed results: it's beneficial in one aspect but falls short in the primary objective. If Udacity were to ask about rolling this out to everyone, the advice would be to proceed with caution, possibly consider further optimizations or investigations to understand the discrepancy between the improved payment rate and the unchanged OEC. Essentially, the intervention shows potential, but further work is needed to fully achieve Udacity's goals without unintended consequences."

    ">The reduction in the standard error to 0.0066 after adding date indicators significantly enhances the precision of our estimate of the treatment's effect on the OEC. This improvement means we can trust the results more, giving Udacity a clearer picture of how their website changes are truly performing. If the treatment effect on the OEC remains not statistically significant even with this enhanced precision, it suggests that the website changes may not have the intended positive impact. However, if this finer analysis reveals a significant effect, it signals a more definitive influence of the changes, whether positive or negative. Therefore, with this increased accuracy, Udacity should re-evaluate the statistical and practical significance of the experiment's outcomes. This sharper analysis could justify moving forward with the website changes if the evidence supports it, or it might caution against a full rollout if the desired improvements in user behavior are not evident. In essence, this result provides Udacity with a more reliable foundation for their decision-making regarding the experiment."
