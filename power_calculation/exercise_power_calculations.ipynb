    "# Power Calculations and Experiment Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "When you read about them in a book, power calculations can feel very abstract. To make the concept more concrete, and to give you a chance to familiarize yourself with power calculation tools and the considerations that go into power calculations, in this exercise you will play the role of an experiment planner hired by a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) named [Bandhan](https://www.bandhan.org/) in West Bengal, India. Bandhan is planning to roll out a program that provides livestock, cash, and some basic training to households in extreme poverty. They hope to demonstrate the value of cash and asset transfers, and so wish their program to take the form of a randomized experiment, with data being collected on both control and treatment households.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job will be to help them estimate how many households they should enroll in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was, in fact, a real program, and so the data you will be working with comes from the actual program (conducted in 2007, with followup data collection in 2010, 2017, and 2020), allowing us to do some retrospective comparison of your power calculations and what actually occurred."

    "## The Context\n",
    "\n",
    "> Development economics has long posited that the poor may be poor for no good reason other than the fact that they started poor. This is the idea of a poverty trap, which has the implication that a one-time capital grant that makes very poor households significantly less poor (\"big push\") might set off a virtuous cycle that takes them out of poverty. Forty-three countries now embrace some version of this idea and make large transfers to over 3.1 million of their poorest households. In particular, the \"Targeting the Ultra Poor\" (TUP) intervention, pioneered by BRAC in Bangladesh, employs a multifaceted approach, offering poor households an asset transfer, consumption support, savings, and training in the hopes of unlocking a poverty trap.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [*Long-Term Effects of the Targeting the Ultra Poor Program*](https://economics.mit.edu/research/publications/long-term-effects-targeting-ultra-poor-program), Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Garima Sharma, 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2007, Bandhan in West Bengal, India created a pilot program to provide direct, unconditional transfers of productive livestock and a 30 or 40 week stipend of 90 rupees a week (about 7 US dollars a week using the [Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) exchange rate). The program targeted the poorest households in these villages based on range of criteria, and the average eligible household was later estimated to have a consumption level of about 1.35 2018 US Dollars per capita per day in PPP terms $.^1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the goal of the program was, in significant part, to demonstrate the effect of direct asset transfers, Bandhan identified twice as many eligible households as it could support in the pilot and randomly selected half of the households to act as controls and half to be treated $.^2$ Treated households were offered assets from a menu of options, from the most common choice was productive livestock (e.g., cows and goats). $^3$ Bandhan's contact with the households came to an end 18 months after the households were initially provided their livestock and cash transfers began.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although data was collected on a huge range of attributes of the households in this program, our focus will be on per capita household expenditures in 2018 US Dollars (PPP). \n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that these households certainly were not buying their food with dollars, and in most cases they weren't even buying most of their food with rupees — consumption estimates in this type of study are calculated by collecting detailed data on what household members have consumed in the past week, then estimating the price one would pay to buy those goods in local markets and using [PPP conversion rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) conversion rates to convert that into US Dollars).\n"

    "The idea of the \"power\" of a test is that, when we draw a sample from a population, there's some variation in who happens to end up in that sample. Consequently, even if the *true* effect size in the population is equal to our Minimal Detectable Effect, there's some probability that when we compare treated and untreated outcomes for the $N$ people who actually end up in the study, that Minimal Detectable Effect may not be evident in that sample (at the level of statistical significance $\\alpha$ we have chosen).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that, one way to think of power is: \"If the true effect in the population is our Minimal Detectable Effect, then if I were able to re-run this experiment over and over — drawing new people into the study and testing the difference in outcomes between the control and treated sample each time — then in what percentage of those instances of the experiment would I reject the null hypothesis of no effect?\" Power of 80% means that we'd expect to reject the null of no effect in 80% of those many experiments.\n",

    "To do the experiment you did the power calculations for in Exercise 11, we just need to sample 200 observations from the treated group and 200 from the control group, treat that as our experimental sample, and estimate the difference in per capita month expenditures between those two groups (along with the associated p-value).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can repeat that over and over to simulate \"re-running\" the experiment, each time drawing a new sample of 200 treated observations and 200 control observations. Then we can store the p-values from all these \"re-run\" experiments and see how often we reject the null of no effect!\n",

Increasing the sample size to 300 per arm raised the power to about 0.73. Simulations further demonstrated this effect: the null hypothesis was rejected in 54% of trials with 200 samples, improving to 71% with 300 samples.
